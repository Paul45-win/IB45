**Welcome to Beanstalk Portfolio Optimser**
Our Portfolio Optimser utilises the modern portfolio theory proposed by Markowitz.
**About the website**:
We have used custom elements to make the website as seamless as possible, in a regular website whenever you visit a new website, it refreshes and downloads new files but in our website, we download all our information and have **ONE HTML** file that swaps elements  when a item is displayed. The website works as efficiently on a slow 3G network as it does on a 5G network.
**About the dashboard**
 We have used the following libraries: 
   **Plotly** for data visualisation, it combines the power of javascript with the power of python to display interactive graphs. 
   **Pyportopt** for the optimser and covariance function
   **Pandas** for utilising the dataframe
   **Numpy** to utilise the array functions 
   **Streamlit** framework for deploying our python application on your website
